# Chennai Traffic Impact Calculator - Security & API Audit Report
Date: July 10, 2025

## Executive Summary

This report provides a comprehensive security audit of all APIs used in the Chennai Traffic Impact Calculator application, with a specific focus on API key security, Google Maps API cost optimization, and overall application security.

## 1. API Security Status

### ✅ Positive Findings

1. **API Keys Are Not Exposed in Frontend Code**
   - Google Maps API key is properly stored in environment variables
   - All Google Maps API calls are proxied through backend endpoints
   - No hardcoded API keys found in client-side code

2. **Razorpay Implementation is Secure**
   - Payment verification happens server-side with signature validation
   - Razorpay secret key is never exposed to frontend
   - Proper validation of payment IDs and amounts
   - Duplicate payment prevention implemented

3. **Admin Endpoints Have Basic Protection**
   - Admin endpoints require API key authentication
   - Contact submissions endpoint has additional localhost check

### ⚠️ Critical Issues Found

1. **No Rate Limiting on Google Maps API Endpoints**
   - `/api/geocode` - No rate limiting
   - `/api/route-info` - No rate limiting  
   - `/api/places/autocomplete` - No rate limiting
   - **Risk**: API costs can explode with malicious or excessive usage

2. **No Caching for Google Maps API Responses**
   - Every autocomplete keystroke triggers an API call
   - Repeated searches for same locations hit API again
   - No caching of geocoding or route results

3. **Missing API Usage Monitoring**
   - No tracking of Google Maps API call counts
   - No alerts for unusual usage patterns
   - No daily/monthly usage limits

4. **Weak Admin Authentication**
   - Admin API key stored in plain environment variable
   - No proper authentication system for admin access

## 2. Google Maps API Cost Analysis

### Current Usage Patterns

1. **Place Autocomplete**
   - Triggered on every keystroke after 3 characters
   - 300ms debounce helps but still generates many calls
   - Average user types 10-20 characters = 3-5 API calls per search

2. **Geocoding**
   - Called twice per calculation (origin + destination)
   - No caching means repeated addresses hit API again

3. **Directions API**
   - Called once per calculation for route info
   - Most expensive API call ($5 per 1000 requests)

### Estimated Monthly Costs (at current usage)
- Place Autocomplete: $2.83/1000 requests
- Geocoding: $5/1000 requests  
- Directions: $5/1000 requests

**Without optimization**: 1000 daily users could generate $300-500/month

## 3. Security Vulnerabilities

### High Priority
1. API abuse through unlimited requests
2. No request validation for autocomplete input length
3. Missing CORS configuration
4. No API key rotation mechanism

### Medium Priority
1. Session IDs are predictable
2. No HTTPS enforcement in production
3. Email credentials in environment variables
4. No security headers (Helmet not configured)

## 4. Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **Implement Rate Limiting**
   - 10 requests/minute for autocomplete per IP
   - 20 requests/minute for geocoding per IP
   - 10 requests/minute for directions per IP

2. **Add Response Caching**
   - Cache autocomplete results for 24 hours
   - Cache geocoding results for 7 days
   - Cache route calculations for 1 hour

3. **Optimize Autocomplete**
   - Increase debounce to 500ms
   - Minimum 4 characters before search
   - Implement local Chennai location suggestions

4. **Add Usage Monitoring**
   - Track API calls per endpoint
   - Set up daily usage alerts
   - Implement hard limits with user-friendly errors

5. **Security Hardening**
   - Configure Helmet.js for security headers
   - Implement proper CORS policy
   - Add request validation middleware
   - Use environment-specific API keys

### Long-term Improvements

1. Replace simple admin API key with proper JWT authentication
2. Implement API key rotation schedule
3. Add comprehensive logging and alerting
4. Consider using Google Maps JavaScript API with session tokens
5. Implement progressive enhancement for offline functionality

## 5. Data Protection

### Current Status
- User data properly stored in PostgreSQL
- Passwords not stored (good - no user auth)
- IP addresses logged for rate limiting
- No PII in logs

### Recommendations
- Implement data retention policies
- Add database backup strategy
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest

## 6. Implementation Priority

1. **Critical (Within 24 hours)**
   - Rate limiting on Maps API endpoints
   - Basic caching layer
   - Usage monitoring

2. **High (Within 1 week)**  
   - Optimize autocomplete behavior
   - Add security headers
   - Implement API call budgets

3. **Medium (Within 1 month)**
   - Proper admin authentication
   - Comprehensive monitoring
   - API key rotation

## Conclusion

While the application follows good practices for API key security (keys not exposed in frontend), the lack of rate limiting and caching poses a significant financial risk through potential Google Maps API cost overruns. Immediate implementation of rate limiting and caching is critical to prevent unexpected costs.

The security posture is generally good but requires hardening through proper rate limiting, monitoring, and security headers. The recommended changes will significantly improve both security and cost efficiency.
