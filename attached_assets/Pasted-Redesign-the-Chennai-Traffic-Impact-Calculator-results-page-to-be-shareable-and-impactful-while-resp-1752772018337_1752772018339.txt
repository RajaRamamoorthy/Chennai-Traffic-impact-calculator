BALANCED SCORE-BASED MESSAGING:

1. EXCELLENT SCORE (0-30):
   - Hero: "You've mastered the Chennai commute! 🎯"
   - Money line: "Spending only ₹{cost}/month"
   - Context: "That's ₹{savings} less than most commuters"
   - Share hook: "Share your commute hack"

2. GOOD SCORE (31-50):
   - Hero: "Smart commuting, but ₹{potential_savings} is hiding! 👀"
   - Money line: "Currently spending ₹{cost}/month"
   - Context: "Better than 60% of Chennai, but could save more"
   - Share hook: "Compare with friends"

3. MODERATE SCORE (51-70):
   - Hero: "Your commute's secret cost: ₹{cost}/month 💸"
   - Money line: "That's ₹{annual} per year on just getting to work"
   - Context: "Higher than 70% of Chennai commuters"
   - Share hook: "This surprised me..."

4. HIGH SCORE (71-100):
   - Hero: "Whoa! ₹{cost}/month on commuting? 🚨"

   - Context: "Among Chennai's costliest 20% commutes"
   - Share hook: "Check if yours is similar"

UNIVERSAL COMPARISONS (Broadly Relatable):

"Your ₹{cost} monthly commute equals:"
- 🛵 {percentage}% of a new Activa's EMI
- 📱 {months} months of unlimited mobile data
- 🎬 {number} movie tickets (or {ott_months} months of streaming)
- 🍛 {meals} decent meals
- ⚡ {units} units of electricity
- 🏃 {gym_months} months at a local gym

Mix practical (electricity) with lifestyle (movies) - something for everyone.

MONEY FRAMING THAT WORKS:

Instead of "burning/wasting", use active but neutral:
- "Your commute costs ₹X" ✓
- "You're spending ₹X on getting to work" ✓
- "₹X goes into your daily commute" ✓
- "That's ₹X leaving your pocket monthly" ✓ (slight emotion)

TIME FRAMING WITH IMPACT:

- "{hours} hours/month = {movies} movies worth of time"
- "Annual commute time: {days} complete days"
- Add context: "Chennai average: {avg_hours} hours"

SHAREABLE MOMENTS WITHOUT DRAMA:

For HIGH COSTS:
"Just calculated my Chennai commute cost: ₹{cost}/month! 😮 
That's more than I realized. What's yours? {link}"

For EFFICIENT COMMUTES:
"My Chennai commute costs just ₹{cost}/month ✨
Below city average! Calculate yours: {link}"

For AVERAGE:
"Interesting - my Chennai commute: ₹{cost}/month
Right at city average. Check yours: {link}"

CONTEXTUAL NUGGETS (Factual but Impactful):

Peak hour drivers:
"💡 Peak hour adds ~40% to commute costs"

Short distance car users:
"🚲 Fun fact: 65% choose two-wheelers for <5km in Chennai"

Solo commuters:
"🚗 Solo vs Shared: ₹{solo_cost} vs ₹{shared_cost}"

VISUAL EMOTION WITHOUT JUDGMENT:

Use colors strategically:
- Green: Savings, efficiency 
- Orange: Attention, notable
- Red: Only for highest costs
- Blue: Information, tips

Emojis that work:
- 💸 (money flying) - universally understood
- 🎯 (target) - achievement
- 👀 (eyes) - discovery
- ⏰ (clock) - time
- 📊 (chart) - data

BALANCED SHARE BUTTONS:

- "Share this discovery 🔍" (neutral)
- "Compare with friends 👥" (social)
- "Spread the word 📢" (active)

Not: "Warn everyone!" or "Brag about this!"

KEY BALANCE POINTS:

1. Use surprise, not shock: "Whoa!" not "SHOCKING!"
2. Make it about discovery: "Your commute's secret cost"
3. Use comparisons everyone understands: meals, mobile data, movies
4. Let users interpret waste: Show cost, let them decide if it's too much
5. Focus on information sharing: "This surprised me" vs "This is terrible"

The sweet spot: Make users think "Hmm, that's more than I thought" rather than "OMG I'm doomed!" Natural sharing comes from genuine surprise, not manufactured panic.
