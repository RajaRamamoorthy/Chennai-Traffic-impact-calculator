## Overview

This is a Chennai Traffic Impact Calculator web application that helps Chennai commuters understand their traffic impact and discover better alternatives. The application uses a modern full-stack architecture with React frontend, Express.js backend, PostgreSQL database with Drizzle ORM, and integrates with Google Maps API for location services.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React with TypeScript using Vite as the build tool
- **UI Library**: Shadcn/ui components with Radix UI primitives
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with CSS variables for theming
- **State Management**: React Query (TanStack Query) for server state
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing

### Backend Architecture
- **Framework**: Express.js with TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations
- **Connection**: Neon Database serverless connection
- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints with proper error handling

### Database Schema
The application uses PostgreSQL with the following main tables:
- `users` - Basic user tracking with session IDs
- `vehicleTypes` - Transportation modes with emission factors and costs
- `calculations` - Route calculations and impact results
- `feedback` - User feedback and analytics
- `routeCongestion` - Traffic congestion data by area

## Key Components

### Calculator Flow
- **Multi-step form**: Transportation selection → Route details → Results
- **Step persistence**: Form data saved to localStorage with auto-restore
- **Real-time validation**: Zod schemas for type-safe form validation

### External Integrations
- **Google Maps API**: Geocoding, place autocomplete, and route information
- **Location Services**: Address validation and distance calculations

### Impact Calculation Engine
- Considers vehicle type, occupancy, timing, frequency, and route congestion
- Provides detailed breakdown of traffic impact score (0-100)
- Generates alternative transportation suggestions

## Data Flow

1. **User Input**: Multi-step form collects transportation mode, vehicle details, origin/destination, timing, and frequency
2. **Geocoding**: Addresses converted to coordinates using Google Maps API
3. **Route Calculation**: Distance and route information retrieved
4. **Impact Analysis**: Backend calculates traffic impact score and alternatives
5. **Results Display**: Comprehensive results with breakdown, alternatives, and recommendations
6. **Feedback Collection**: Optional user feedback for continuous improvement

## External Dependencies

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## Development Best Practices

### Content Security Policy (CSP) Management
- **Always include both `script-src` AND `script-src-elem` directives** when allowing external scripts
- Modern browsers may require explicit `script-src-elem` even when `script-src` is present
- Test all external script loading (analytics, payments, etc.) after any CSP changes
- Common external domains to include: Google Analytics, Microsoft Clarity, Razorpay, Replit
- **CSP Update Checklist**: After adding new external services, verify scripts load in browser console

### API Validation Schema Patterns
- **Separate input schemas from database schemas** - never validate output-only fields on API inputs
- Create dedicated `InputSchema` variants that exclude computed fields (id, createdAt, calculated results)
- Database schemas (insertCalculationSchema) include ALL fields; API input schemas include only user-provided fields
- **Input Schema Checklist**: Ensure validation schemas only include fields the frontend actually sends
- Use descriptive schema names: `calculationInputSchema` vs `insertCalculationSchema` for clarity

## Security Architecture

### API Security Implementation
- **Rate Limiting**: All Google Maps API endpoints protected with configurable rate limits
  - Autocomplete: 10 requests/minute per IP
  - Geocoding: 20 requests/minute per IP
  - Directions: 10 requests/minute per IP
- **Caching Layer**: In-memory caching reduces API calls by 70-80%
  - Autocomplete results cached for 24 hours
  - Geocoding results cached for 7 days  
  - Route calculations cached for 1 hour
- **Frontend Optimization**: 
  - Debounce increased to 500ms (from 300ms)
  - Minimum 4 characters required for autocomplete
- **Security Headers**: Helmet.js configured with CSP, XSS protection, and other security headers
- **API Monitoring**: Real-time usage tracking with cost estimation at `/api/admin/api-usage`

### Cost Control Measures
- Estimated 70-80% reduction in Google Maps API costs through caching
- Rate limiting prevents abuse and unexpected cost spikes
- Daily usage reports logged to console
- Admin endpoint provides real-time cost estimates
